## Description of the Triangle Tracker program
<p>I built an application that helps us know whether a triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all.
Some points to note are:
<ol>
<li>For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.</li>
<li>For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.</li>
<li>For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.</li>
<li>If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values.</li></p>
</ol>

|-------------------            | :---------------------------------------:  |------------------------------:|
|The program determines whether |length-1 (12) length-2 (12) length-3 (12)   |This is an equilateral triangle|
the three sides  are equal to an
equilateral triangle                                                                          
|The program determines whether |length-1 (10) length-2(10) length-3 (13)    |This is an isosceles triangle  |  
the three sides are equal to an
isosceles triangle                                                                              
|The program determines whether |length-1 (9) length-2(10) length-3(11)      |This is a scalene triangle     |
the three sides are equal to an  
scalene triangle                                                                               
|Not a triangle                 |length-1 (9) length-2 (4) length-3 (3)      |This cannot form a triangle    |
